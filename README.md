## Setup

vote assumes you have a MongoDB-server running on `mongodb://localhost:27017/vote` and a redis-server running as `localhost:6379`. To change the URL, export `MONGO_URL` and `REDIS_URL` as an environment variable.

```bash
# Start MongoDB and Redis, both required for development and production
$ docker-compose up -d
# Install all dependencies
$ yarn && yarn start
```

## Usage

#### Users

Initially you will need to create a moderator and or admin user in order to login

```bash
# Create a user via the CLI. You are prompted to select usertype.
$ ./bin/users create-user <username> <cardKey>
```

#### Card-readers

vote uses a RFID-reader to register and activate/deactivate users. This is done to make sure that only people that are at the location can vote. The RFID-reader needs to be connected to the computer that is logged in to the moderator panel. See section about using the card reader further down this readme.

### Development

> Check docs for the environment variable `ETHEREAL` if you intend to develop email related features

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Environment variables

- `MONGO_URL`
  - Url to the database connection
  - `default`: `mongodb://localhost:27017/vote`
- `REDIS_URL`
  - Hostname of the redis server
  - `default`: `localhost`
- `ICON_SRC` _(optional)_
  - Url to the main icon on all pages
  - `default`: `/static/images/Abakule.jpg`
- `LOGO_SRC` _(optional)_
  - External email to url to the main logo
  - `default`: `https://abakus.no/185f9aa436cf7f5da598fd7e07700efd.png`
- `COOKIE_SECRET`
  - **IMPORTANT** to change this to a secret value in production!!
  - `default`: in dev: `localsecret`, otherwise empty
- `GOOGLE_AUTH`
  - A base64 encoded string with the json data of a service account that can send mail. We also store
    the `abakus_from_email` in the data object. Note that the `GOOGLE_AUTH` variable is only used when
    VOTE is running in production, in development the `ETHERAL` variable can be used.
- `ETHEREAL`
  - A optional variable you can set that allows emails to be routed to a test `smtp` server. This is
    useful if you intend to make changes to the way emails are sent, or the way the template looks.
    The variable must be on the format `user:pass`, that you can find [here](https://ethereal.email/create).

See `app.js` and `env.js` for the rest

### Production

> For a production deployment example, see [deployment](./deployment/README.md) in the `deployment` folder

```bash
$ yarn build
$ ICON_SRC=https://someicon.png LOGO_SRC=https://somelogo.png NODE_ENV=production GOOGLE_AUTH=base64encoding yarn start
```

## Using the card-readers

Make sure you have enabled Experimental Web Platform features and are using Google Chrome. Experimental features can be enabled by navigating to: **chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features**.
Please check that the USB card reader is connected. When prompted for permissions, please select the card reader (CP210x).

### Serial permissions (Linux)

When using the card readers on a linux based system there can be permission problems with **google-chrome**. Chrome needs access to the ports, and often the ports are controlled by another group, so chrome cannot use them. Therefore you must do one of the following:

1. Run google-chrome as `root`

```sh
$ sudo google-chrome
```

**OR**

2. Add your user to the `dialout` group.
   - Check what group the tty(USBPORT) is:
   ```
   $ ls -al /dev/ttyUSB* | cut -d ' ' -f 2`
   ```
   - Check what groups your user is added to:
   ```sh
   $ groups
   ```
   - Normally the `tty` is in the `dialout` group, so add your user to that group with:
   ```sh
   $ sudo usrmod -a -G dialout $USER
   ```

> You need to sign in and out to get the new privileges!

## Tests

vote uses mocha for the backend tests and cucumber.js/protractor for the frontend tests. To run them all you can do:

```bash
$ yarn test
# To run in headless mode:
$ HEADLESS=true yarn test
```

## Vote Occasion

We have a list of every occasion vote has been used. If you or your organization use vote for your event we would love if you made a PR where you append your event to the list.

The list is located at `./usage.yml`. Just create a new entry at the bottom. Then run `yarn lint` to see if your YAML is correct.
